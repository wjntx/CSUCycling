						<font size="3">
						<p style="line-height:1.4em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.9em">Rams Cycling Team strives to provide students and faculty with a high caliber cycling team which competes in both road and mountain disciplines at the regional and national level. The Team's focus is racing, though we also organize rides for cyclist of any level and host a variety of social events throughout the school year. The Team operates throughout the entire school year to provide students the opportunity to compete in road biking and BMX during the spring with track, mountain and downhill biking during the fall, and the ever glorious Cyclocross in the fall/winter. Our goal is to send a full team to Collegiate National&nbsp;Championships in each discipline.</p>
						<p style="line-height:1.4em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.9em">With Collegiate Track Nationals and Collegiate Cyclocross Nationals both in Colorado (Track in Colorado Springs, Sept 19-22; Cyclocross in Boulder, Jan 2014) we are pushing for full teams! BMX will likely be in Phoenix, AZ; Road in Richmond, VA; and Mountain/Downhill in Banner Elk, NC. Those far races help us showcase our talents as an all around team.</p>

										<span style="line-height:1.4em;background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt"><font size="3">The team started as the Spring Creek Velo Club in the late 1970s. In 1980 the club re-formed as the Rocky Mountain Cyclists. In 1982 the club began working in the bike shop located in the Lory Student Center. During the 1984-1985 school year the club once again began to focus on racing.</span></p>

										<p style="line-height:1.4em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.9em">The CSU Oval Criterium is the most respected road race in Northern Colorado. First held in 1986, it is one of the oldest races in Colorado. Racers travel from all over the state to compete on the Oval at Colorado State University. There are events for Collegiate and USCF (United States Cycling Federation) in all categories from Citizen to Pro. This is a primary fundraiser for the Rams Cycling Team spring racing season.</p>
										<p style="line-height:1.4em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.9em">Since 1995, Northern Coloradoâ€™s premier mountain bike race, Beaver Meadows MTB Festival, a multi-event mountain bike race at Beaver Meadows Resort Ranch in Red Feather, CO has been promoted by Rams Cycling. It is a weekend of truly incredible mountain bike racing. There are races in three disciplines, cross country, short track and downhill. There are races for Collegiate and NORBA (National Off Road Bicycle Association) in all categories from Beginner to Pro. This is a primary fundraiser for the Rams Cycling Team fall racing season.</p>
										<p style="line-height:1.4em;margin-top:0.5em;margin-bottom:0.9em">The Team has a good deal to offer to cyclist of all levels. Group rides take place 3-5 times per week including the famous Wednesday Night Worlds. Throughout the year we invite in guest speaker and host other events. Any CSU student, faculty or alumni can join the Team, though you must be a full time student to race.</p></font>
